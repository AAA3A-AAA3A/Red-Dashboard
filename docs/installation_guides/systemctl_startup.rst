    Many thanks to Neuro for the initial project and for this detailed documentation!

Automatic Startup (systemctl)
=============================

.. warning::

    This guide is for **Linux only.** There's is no auto-restart system for Windows or Mac at the moment.

.. warning::

    If you plan to run this with multiple bots, you will need to add the flags you normally add to the ExecStart line. Additionally, if you have multiple systemctl files for the dashboard, you will need to rename them.


Creating the service file
-------------------------

In order to create the service file, you will first need to know two things, your Linux ``username`` and your Python ``path``.

First, your Linux ``username`` can be fetched with the following command:

.. code-block:: none

    whoami

Next, your python ``path`` can be fetched with the following commands:

.. code-block:: none

    # If reddash is installed in a venv.
    source ~/reddashenv/bin/activate
    which python

    # If reddash is installed in a pyenv virtualenv.
    pyenv shell <virtualenv_name>
    pyenv which python

Then create the new service file:

``sudo -e /etc/systemd/system/reddash.service``

Replace ``path`` with your python path and ``username`` with your Linux username.

.. code-block:: none

    [Unit]
    Description=Red-Dashboard
    After=multi-user.target
    After=network-online.target
    Wants=network-online.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=path -O -m reddash
    User=username
    Group=username
    Type=idle
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=15
    RestartPreventExitStatus=0
    TimeoutStopSec=10

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Save your file and exit: ``ctrl + O; enter; ctrl + x``

Now you can start the webserver by using:

.. code-block:: none

    # Start Dashboard.
    sudo systemctl start reddash

    # Stop Dashboard.
    sudo systemctl stop reddash

Automatic startup on system bootup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To automatically start the webserver at system's bootup, use the following command:

.. code-block:: none

    # Enable automatic startup.
    sudo systemctl enable reddash

    # Disable automatic startup.
    sudo systemctl disable reddash

Check logs
~~~~~~~~~~

To check Dashboard's logs, use:

.. code-block:: none

    sudo journalctl -eu reddash

.. tip:: 

    You can use the ``--following`` flag to see live logs, to check if there's any trouble while using the Dashboard.
